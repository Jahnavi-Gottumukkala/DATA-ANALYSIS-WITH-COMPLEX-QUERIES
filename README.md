## Overview

This project performs **advanced data analysis** on a sample sales database using SQL Server. The goal is to generate insights into customer spending, product performance, and sales trends.  

The queries leverage:  

- **CTEs (Common Table Expressions):** for modular query structure  
- **Window Functions:** for ranking, cumulative totals, moving averages, and percent contributions  
- **Subqueries:** for filtering based on averages and percentiles
